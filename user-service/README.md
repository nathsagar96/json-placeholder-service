# User Service API

## Overview

This is a Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API for managing users. The API allows clients to create,
retrieve, update, and delete users. Each user contains a name, username, email, address, phone, website, and company
information.

## Prerequisites

- Java
- Maven
- Spring Boot
- Docker

## Getting Started

### Go to the project directory

```bash
cd user-service
```

### Build the project

Use Maven to build the project:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Build the Docker image

If you prefer to run the service as a Docker container, build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t user-service:latest .
```

### Run the application

Ensure the following services are running before starting the application:

- Config Service
- Discovery Service
- Loki
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Tempo

If these services are not running, start them using the docker-compose.yml file in the root directory.

You can run the application either locally using Maven or as a Docker container.

#### Option 1: Run with Maven

Start the Spring Boot application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start and be accessible at `http://localhost:8085`.

#### Option 2: Run with Docker

Run the container using the built image:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8085:8085 user-service:latest
```

The application will start and be accessible at `http://localhost:8085`.
